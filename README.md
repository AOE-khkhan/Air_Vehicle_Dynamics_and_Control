Air Vehicle Dynamics and Control Project

The following technical tasks were performed on a Fixed-wing Small UAV.
1) Rigid-body dynamical system model and its numerical simulation.
2) Simulation of on-board sensors with measurement errors.
3) State estimation from sensor data.
4) Stabilization and tracking control.
5) Testing and visualization.
